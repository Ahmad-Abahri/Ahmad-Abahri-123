<ul>
<li><h2><b style ="background-color:pink;color:black">British Mandate</b></h2></li>
<h2><b style="color:black;">On September 11, 1922, the League of Nations officially approved the mandate, by issuing a deed entrusting the administration of Palestine to Britain; This is based on the agreement of the Allied countries to implement a British royal declaration issued in 1917, known as the Balfour Declaration, and it was mentioned in more than one place in the Declaration of the League of Nations, an affirmation not to take action that would harm the civil and religious rights of the indigenous people of Palestine and the preservation of their rights, in line with the encouragement of cooperation with The Zionist Association to facilitate the immigration of Jews to Palestine and to acquire Palestinian citizenship for those immigrants, as a guarantee for the establishment of a homeland A Jewish national for them, according to the text of the decision. The resolution defined the mandate area for Palestine, including Transjordan, but Article 25 of it allowed for the postponement or cessation of the application of texts to it, and it was actually excluded from the mandate in 1921 according to the Transjordan Memorandum, so the Emirate of Transjordan enjoyed self-rule and was not subject to the principles of the mandate or the Balfour Declaration . The Emirate of Transjordan became independent from British authority in 1946 to become the Kingdom of Jordan, and thus it was de facto excluded from the borders of the mandate over Palestine, so the mandate over Palestine remained between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean until the end of the mandate in 1948, and those are the borders of Palestine in which both the State of Israel and the West Bank are located today. West and the Gaza Strip, The city of Jerusalem was the capital of the Mandate, where the British governor and the institutions of the Mandate government resided. At the beginning of the Mandate period, Britain declared a goal to achieve the Balfour Declaration, i.e. open the door for Jews wishing to emigrate to Palestine and establish a Jewish “national home” there. In the mid-thirties of the twentieth century, Britain changed its policy and tried to stop the influx of Jews into Palestine and prevent the purchase of land by the Jews.</b></h2>
